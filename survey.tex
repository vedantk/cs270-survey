\section*{Abstract}

Graph sparsification produces sparse approximations of input graphs.  In
this paper we survey major results in spectral sparsification, a special
case in which important structural and algebraic properties of graphs are
preserved.  We provide intuition for the theory by explaining a key result:
that every graph has a spectral sparsifier with $O(\epsilon^{-2}|V|\log|V|)$
edges w.h.p. We finish by discussing some applications, such as computing
electrical flows and finding min $s$-$t$ cuts.

\section*{Introduction}

Research in graph sparsification has been motivated by the fact that sparse
graphs are easier to compute with than dense graphs.
